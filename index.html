            <p>Welcome! My name is Ellie, and I am an aspiring animator based in the United Kingdom. Currently, I am a college student specialising in Game Design and Development, with a primary focus on animation. My passion lies in bringing characters and worlds to life through dynamic and engaging animations.</p>
            
            <p> Beyond the realms of animation, I have always enjoyed reading. I am constantly captivated in the world written on the pages of a book and I would not have it any other way, it helps fuel my creativity and ignites new ideas. Furthermore, I enjoy watching a wide range of cartoons for all age demographics, however those aimed at a younger audience engage me the most. Bluey is currently one of my favourite cartoons as it has bite-sized, fun-loving episodes. I also have always enjoyed going out for walks and playing sports.</p>
 
            <p>In the future I plan to take my animation to degree level, where I aspire to delve deeper into the world of animation. My overall goal is to be part of the creation of an animation which utilises makaton, aiming to raise awareness and make those of the deaf community feel seen and represented.</p>
